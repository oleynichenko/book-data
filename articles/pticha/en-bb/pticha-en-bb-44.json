This produces a Zivug de Hakaa only at the level of the female, the level of Behina Gimel, which is the level of Hochma, called HaVaYaH de AB. The upper Zivug, when the female is included in the male, is considered the level of the male, which is nearly the level of Keter. And the lower Zivug, when the male is included in the female, is considered the female level, which is only the level of Hochma."

        "content": "Yet, the Aviut in the male level does not come from himself, but by means of Hitkalelut with the female. And although it suffices to elicit the level of ten Sefirot from below upward, called Rosh, this level still cannot spread from above downward in the form of a Guf, which would mean clothing of lights in the Kelim. This is so because a Zivug de Hakaa on Aviut that comes from Hitkalelut is insufficient for the expansion of Kelim."

        "content": "Hence, the male level contains only a discernment of Rosh, without a Guf. The Guf of the Partzuf extends only from the female level, which has her own Aviut. For this reason, we name the Partzuf only after the female level, meaning Partzuf AB. This is so because the core of the Partzuf is its Gufâ€”the clothing of the lights in the Kelim. And this emerges only from the female level, as we have explained. This is why the Partzuf is named after her."
