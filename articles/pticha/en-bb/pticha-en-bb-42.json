It is because the Bitush of Ohr Makif and Ohr Pnimi, applied in each Partzuf, always cancels the last Behina of Reshimo of Aviut in there. Yet, we should know that there are two discernments in the Reshimot that remain in the Masach after its Hizdakchut [purification]. The first is called Reshimo de Aviut, and the second is called Reshimo de Hitlabshut [clothing]."

        "content": "For instance, once the Masach de Guf of the first Partzuf in AK has been purified, we said that the last Behina of the Reshimot de Aviut, the Reshimo of Behina Dalet, was lost, and all that remained in the Masach was the Reshimo of Aviut de Behina Gimel. Yet, although the Reshimo of Behina Dalet contains two discernments, as we have said—Hitlabshut and Aviut—only the Reshimo de Aviut of Behina Dalet had disappeared from the Masach by that Hizdakchut. But the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of Behina Dalet remained in that Masach and did not disappear from it."

        "content": "Reshimo de Hitlabshut refers to a very subtle Behina [discernment] from the Reshimo of Behina Dalet, which does not contain sufficient Aviut for a Zivug de Hakaa with the upper light. This Reshimo remains from the last Behina in each Partzuf during its Hizdakchut. And our saying that the last Behina disappears from each Partzuf during its Hizdakchut refers only to the Reshimo de Aviut in it."
