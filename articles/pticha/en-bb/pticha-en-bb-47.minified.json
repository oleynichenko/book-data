[{"articleId":"47","authorId":"bb","langId":"en","title":"Paragraph 47","bookId":"pticha","chunks":[{"chunkId":"1","content":"It has been explained that through the Bitush of Ohr Makif in the Masach de Guf, it purifies the Masach of all the Aviut de Guf until it is purified and equalizes with the Masach de Peh de Rosh. The equivalence of form with the Peh de Rosh unites them as one, and it is included in the Zivug de Hakaa in it."},{"chunkId":"2","content":"However, the Masach is not purified at once, but gradually: first from Behina Dalet to Behina Gimel, then from Behina Gimel to Behina Bet, then from Behina Bet to Behina Aleph, and then from Behina Aleph to Behinat [Behina of] Shoresh. Finally, it is purified from all its Aviut and becomes as pure as the Masach de Peh de Rosh."},{"chunkId":"3","content":"The upper light does not stop shining for even a moment and mates with the Masach at every stage of its Hizdakchut. This is because once it has been purified of Behina Dalet and the level of Keter has been entirely removed, and the Masach came to Aviut of Behina Gimel, the upper light mates with the Masach on the remaining Aviut of Behina Gimel and produces ten Sefirot at the level of Hochma."},{"chunkId":"4","content":"Afterward, when the Masach departs from Behina Gimel, too, and the level of Hochma departs, as well, leaving only Behina Bet in the Masach, the upper light mates with it on Behina Bet and produces ten Sefirot at the level of Bina. Then, when it has been purified of Behina Bet, too, and this level has departed, leaving only Aviut of Behina Aleph in it, the upper light mates with the Masach on the remaining Aviut of Behina Aleph and produces ten Sefirot at the level of ZA. And when it has been purified of Aviut de Behina Aleph, too, and the level of ZA has departed, it remains with only the Shoresh [root] of the Aviut."},{"chunkId":"5","content":"In that state, the upper light makes a Zivug on Aviut Shoresh that remains in the Masach and produces ten Sefirot at the level of Malchut. And when the Masach is purified of Aviut Shoresh, too, the level of Malchut departs thence, too, since no Aviut de Guf remains there. In that state, it is considered that the Masach and its Reshimot rose and united with the Masach de Rosh, became included there in a Zivug de Hakaa and produced a new ten Sefirot over it, called a “child” and a “consequence” of the first Partzuf."},{"chunkId":"6","content":"Thus we have explained that the Bitush of Ohr Makif and Ohr Pnimi that purifies the Masach de Guf of the first Partzuf of AK and elevates it to its Peh de Rosh, by which the second Partzuf, AB de AK, emerges, is not done at once. Rather, it occurs gradually, as the upper light mates with it at each state in the four degrees it traverses during its Hizdakchut, until it equalizes with the Peh de Rosh."},{"chunkId":"7","content":"And as it has been explained regarding the elicitation of the four levels during the Hizdakchut of the Guf of the first Partzuf for AB’s purpose, three levels emerge during the Hizdakchut period of the Masach de Guf of Partzuf AB, as it emanates Partzuf SAG, and similarly in all the degrees. The rule is this: A Masach does not purify at once, but gradually. And the upper light, which does not stop spreading to the lower one, mates with it at each degree along its purification."}]}]
