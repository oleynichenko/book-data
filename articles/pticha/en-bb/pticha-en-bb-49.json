        "content": "Thus we have learned the four types of light, called Taamim, Nekudot, Tagin, Otiot. The first level to emerge in each Partzuf of the five Partzufim called Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA, and BON, is called Taamim. The levels that emerge in each Partzuf once it has started to purify, until it is completely purified, are called Nekudot. The Reshimot that remain of the lights of Taamim in each level, after their departure, are called Tagin, and the Reshimot that remain from the lights of the levels of Nekudot after their departure are called Otiot or Kelim. Remember this in all five Partzufim called Galgalta, AB, SAG, MA, and BON, for in all of them there is Hizdakchut and they all have these four types of lights."
