But there, the male level is nearly at the level of Hochma, as it is from the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of Behina Gimel in the Hitkalelut of the Aviut of Behina Bet. And the female level is at the level of Bina, from Aviut of Behina Bet. Here, too, the Partzuf is named solely after the female level, since the male is a Rosh without a Guf."},{"chunkId":"2","content":"Similarly, in Partzuf MA de AK, the male level is nearly at the level of Bina, called “the level of YESHSUT,” as it is from the Reshimo of Behina Bet de Hitlabshut, with Hitkalelut of Aviut from Behina Aleph, while the female level is only the level of ZA, as it is only Behina Aleph de Aviut. Here, too, the Partzuf is named solely after the female, meaning Partzuf MA or Partzuf VAK, since the male is a Rosh without a Guf. You will find it likewise in all the Partzufim."}]}]
