This causes the Masach de Guf to purify, all the lights of the Guf to depart, and the Masach with the Reshimot that remain in it rise to Peh de Rosh, where they are renewed with a new Zivug de Hakaa, and produce a new level in the measure of Aviut in the Reshimot. Now we shall explain the four types of lights, TANTA [Taamim, Nekudot, Tagin, Otiot], occurring with the Bitush of Ohr Makif and the ascents of the Masach to Peh de Rosh."
