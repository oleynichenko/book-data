Rather, they are considered Nekudot, and they are called Ohr Hozer and Din [judgment], since the power of Din of the departure of the lights is already mingled in them. This is so because in the first Partzuf, as soon as the Bitush began to occur and purified the Masach de Guf from Behina Dalet, it is considered as having been completely purified, since there is no “some” in the spiritual."

        "content": "And once it begins to purify, it has to purify completely. Yet, since the Masach purifies gradually, there is time for the upper light to mate with it at each degree of Aviut that the Masach assumes during its Hizdakchut, until it is completely purified. Hence, the force of departure is mingled with the levels that emerge during its departure, and they are considered as only Nekudot and Ohr Hozer and Din."

        "content": "This is why we discern two types of levels in each Partzuf: Taamim and Nekudot. This is so because the first ten Sefirot de Guf that emerge in each Partzuf are called Taamim, and the levels that emerge in the Partzuf as it purifies, after the Masach had already begun to purify until it reaches Peh de Rosh, are called Nekudot."
