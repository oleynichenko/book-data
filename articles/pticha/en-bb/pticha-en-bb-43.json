        "content": "The remainder of the Reshimot de Hitlabshut from the last Behina that remained in each Masach prompted the elicitation of two levels—male and female—in the heads of all the Partzufim: beginning in AB de AK, SAG de AK, MA and BON de AK, and in all the Partzufim of Atzilut. This is so because in Partzuf AB de AK, where there is only Reshimo of Aviut de Behina Gimel in the Masach, which elicits ten Sefirot at the level of Hochma, the Reshimo de Hitlabshut from Behina Dalet, which remained there in the Masach, is unfit for Zivug with the upper light, due to its purity. Yet, it is included with the Aviut of Behina Gimel and becomes one Reshimo. At that time, the Reshimo de Hitlabshut acquires the strength for mating with the upper light. For this reason, the Zivug de Hakaa with the upper light emerged on her, eliciting ten Sefirot at nearly the level of Keter."

        "content": "This is so because she had Hitlabshut of Behina Dalet. This Hitkalelut [mingling/integration] is called Hitkalelut of the female in the male, since the Reshimo de Aviut from Behina Gimel is called “female,” as it carries the Aviut. And the Reshimo de Hitlabshut of Behina Dalet is called “male,” as it comes from a higher place, and because it is purified from Aviut. Thus, although the Reshimo of the male is insufficient for a Zivug de Hakaa in itself, it becomes fit for a Zivug de Hakaa through the Hitkalelut of the female in it."
